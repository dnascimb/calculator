# calculator
The official preparation calculator for JeffThe420Chef's methods (http://www.jeffthe420chef.com/).

This code is free to use and modify. A link back to the original project is appreciated but not required.

The file demo.html is an active demonstration of how one might use the calculator functions. The actual caculator is located in calculator.js and should be reviewed.
